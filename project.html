              <p class="body_text_half_l">I was enlisted to <strong>create</strong> a new competitor in the growing Cloud App market. Overall, the main problem was how to put a fresh spin on a basic idea like cloud storage and somehow make it stand
                out from competition that had
                many of the same core functions. The product required all of the expected features of a cloud storage app (saving, uploading, organizing, and sharing content), while also providing something unique in order to draw the user in.</p>

                some
                competitors, these boards are not limited to storing imagery. They can also accommodate documents and spreadsheets as well as visual content.</p>

            documents”
            were also selected by over 50&#37; of the participants. Of all the primary uses, the response that stood out as by far the least favorable was “organizing digital content” with a less than 20% recorded response rate.

                and file storage. Conversely, I found Pinterest presented itself as more of a social platform that focused soley on visual media. I saw an opportunity for an app with the file creation capacity of the former, with the more social
                interface of the latter where users could share content and inspiration with friends. </p>

        <p class="body_text">In conclusion, I found that the functionality of the app worked well and utilized recognizable design patterns. Some recurring patterns in feedback that I noticed related to use of space and sizing on mobile. I also
          noticed some feedback on using some UI elements that were unnecessary. After the approval of my high-fi wireframes, I made an additional change to help make better use of the space directly on the mobile screen. I have also enlarged the
          size of some of the buttons and removed the scroll bars that I now feel are not necessary after feedback.

        <p class="body_text">I learned about maximizing screen real-estate for essential tasks and how important it is to have visual cues so the user know when things are scrollable.

        <p class="body_text">If I had more time, I would have liked to further develop how to distinguish whose account the user is looking at. Perhaps I could add a trail of breadcrumbs above the image or folder.
