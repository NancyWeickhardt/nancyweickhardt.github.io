          <h3 class="pink_title">Past</h3>
          <p class="body_text">I have always been into design. As a very young child one of my favorite toys was an easel. I loved anything visual. In college I studied studio art however I started to become more interested in graphic design and saw
            it was more potential for a career. I went to Syracuse to study communication design and was always interested in learning how to visually communicate messages and solve problems through design. With a focus in marketing I always
            understood the importance of considering the audience or the user. I began to be fascinated with how you can have great product but it won't reach your audience if you don't get into the mind of the user. </p>

        <section class="future">
          <h3 class="pink_title">Present</h3>
          <p class="body_text">Design is important to me because it is a way for communicating ideas and providing information or content in a way that conveys meaning and familiarity to an audience. I have always been a very visual person and the
            way that I express this is through my design work. </p>
          <p class="body_text">Design is a way for a brand or a product to show their identity by showing consistent brand identity. The quality of the design of the ad directly influences how the audience interacts with the ad and therefore how
            they absorb the message being delivered. Design to highlight specific aspects of a brand or product in order to portray meaningful feelings and moods. Design is also a way to organize information and assets to a way that makes it easy for
            the audience to absorb. </p>
          <p class="body_text">Working as a web producer I was working on marketing emails and although I thought they had a great message and a great product the design of the website they were promoting was severely lacking. I would create
            emails highlighting our great products but links that were embedded in the email would lead the user to cluttered pages full of information on everything but what my ad was selling. This made me determined to enter into the field of
            design in order to create better products that would enhance the user experience. </p>

        <section class="future">
          <h3 class="pink_title">Future</h3>
          <p class="body_text">I am going to influence the future by creating branded content with user friendly interfaces. I want to help build brands that support practices that I am passionate about such as sustainability, progressive
            economics, and social equality. By using brand cues and design systems to effectively communicate my clientâ€™s message, I hope to spread these values to others and create more awareness for these causes I strongly believe in.</p>
