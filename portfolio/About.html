          <p class="project_text">I have always been into design. As a very young child one of my favorite toys was an easel. I loved anything visual. In college I studied studio art however I started to become more interested in graphic design and
            saw it was more potential for a career. I went to Syracuse to study communication design and was always interested in learning how to visually communicate messages and solve problems through design. With a focus in marketing I always
            understood the importance of considering the audience or the user. I began to be fascinated with how you can have great product but it won't reach your audience if you don't get into the mind of the user.

          <h2 class="Section_Title_Pink">Future</h2>
          <p class="project_text">I am going to influence the future by creating branded content with user friendly interfaces. I want to help build brands that support practices that I am passionate about such as sustainability, processgive
            economics, and social equality. By using brand cues and design systems to effectively communicate my clientâ€™s message, I hope to spread these values to others and create more awareness for these causes I strongly believe in.</p>
