<p class="body_text">I was enlisted to create a new competitor in the growing Cloud App market. Overall, the main problem was how to put a fresh spin on a basic idea like cloud storage and somehow make it stand out from competition that had
  many of the same core functions. The product required all of the expected features of a cloud storage app (saving, uploading, organizing, and sharing content), while also providing something unique in order to draw the user in.</p>

        <p class="body_text">The end result, Slice, is a responsive app that allows users to share content directly with their social media accounts as well as create folders which display items on a board-like interface. However, unlike some
          competitors, these boards are not limited to storing imagery. They can also accommodate documents and spreadsheets as well as visual content.</p>

        <p class="caption_text">84.6&#37;of users surveyed selected “storing files” as a primary purpose for using a Cloud platform. 65.4% also selected “sharing files or a group of items with others.” “Backing up files” and “collaborating on
          documents”
          were also selected by over 50&#37; of the participants. Of all the primary uses, the response that stood out as by far the least favorable was “organizing digital content” with a less than 20% recorded response rate.

          and file storage. Whereas, a platform like Pinterest presented itself as more of a social platform which focused soley on visual media. I saw an opportunity for an app with the file creation capacity of the former, while allowing an
          interface where users could share content and inspiration with friends on a more social platform. </p>
