        <h3 class="Section_Title_Pink">Problem</h3>
        <p class="body_text">I was enlisted to create a new competitor in the growing Cloud App market. Overall, the main problem was how to put a fresh spin on a basic idea like cloud storage and somehow make it stand out from competition that had
          many of the same core functions. The product required all of the expected features of a cloud storage app (saving, uploading, organizing, and sharing content), while also providing something unique in order to draw the user in.

        <h3 class="Section_Title_Green">Solution</h3>
        <p class="body_text">The end result, Slice, is a responsive app that allows users to share content directly with their social media accounts as well as create folders which display items on a board-like interface. However, unlike some
          competitors, these boards are not limited to storing imagery. They can also accommodate documents and spreadsheets as well as visual content.

          were also selected by over 50% of the participants. Of all the primary uses, the response that stood out as by far the least favorable was “organizing digital content” with a less than 20% recorded response rate.

        <p class="body_text">I looked at competitors, Evernote, Box, and Pinterest for my Competitve Analysis. I saw a stark contrast between apps like Evernote and Box that’s usage includes in more professional settings and focus on content creation
          and file storage. Whereas, a platform like Pinterest presented itself as more of a social platform which focused soley on visual media. I saw an opportunity for an app with the file creation capacity of the former, while allowing an
          interface where users could share content and inspiration with friends on a more social platform.

        <p class="body_text">Using techniques such as mind-mapping and other discovery exercises, I looked at three different branding ideas based around the app 1) having multiple purposes, 2) being collaborative, or 3) allowing friends to share
          content. The sketches of branding ideas I created focused on these featuresand hoping to give the product a feel of a more social platform, rather than a platform used for business.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">I then narrowed my focus to imagery and ideas that represented the idea of friends coming together and collaborating. I wanted to portray the feeling of friends planning a collaborative event such as a Friendsgiving. I
          thought of pie as something that friends share. I wanted to portray the idea that “slices” of inspiration on content can easily be shared with friends on the app, just like sharing a slice of a pie.

        <p class="body_text">In conclusion, I found that the functionality of the app worked well and utilized recognizable design patterns. Some recurring patterns in feedback that I noticed related to use of space and sizing on mobile. I also
          noticed some feedback on using some UI elements that were unnecessary. After the approval of my high-fi wireframes, I made an additional change to help make better use of the space directly on the mobile screen. I have also enlarged the
          size of some of the buttons and removed the scroll bars that I now feel are not necessary after feedback.
